**Requirements:**  
- Insert this section below the existing hero/banner.  
- Use your site’s CSS variables and typography.  
- Build a 4-column grid on desktop, stacking on mobile.  
- Strike through the original price and add a **“40% OFF”** badge above each discounted price.  
- Add a “Get Lifetime Access” button under each card linking to the checkout page.  
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels) and mobile responsiveness.  
- Include smooth hover states on cards (e.g., lift + shadow).

Generate the updated HTML/CSS (and minimal JS if needed) to implement exactly this.
