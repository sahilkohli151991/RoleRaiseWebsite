## Recommended Solution: Netlify + External Services

Since you want completely free hosting, I recommend using **Netlify** for the frontend with external services for backend functionality:

### Frontend: Netlify (Free)
- Your React website
- Forms processing (built-in)
- Custom domain connection
- Global CDN

### Backend Services (Free tiers):
- **Forms**: Netlify Forms (built-in)
- **PayPal**: Direct PayPal links (no server needed)
- **Calendly**: Already working with direct links

### Modified Architecture for Free Hosting
1. **Static site** on Netlify
2. **PayPal direct links** instead of server processing
3. **Netlify Forms** for assessment submissions
4. **Calendly direct integration**
