# PayPal Credit Card Issue Fix

## Problem
Getting "Things don't appear to be working at the moment" when trying to use credit card payment on PayPal.

## Root Cause
- PayPal sandbox environment occasionally has issues with credit card processing
- This is a temporary PayPal service issue, not a code problem
- The PayPal order creation is working (status 201), but credit card flow fails

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Better Error Handling
- Improved error messages for users
- Automatic fallback to Calendly booking
- Clear instructions for alternative payment methods

### 2. Enhanced PayPal Configuration
- Added proper return/cancel URLs
- Improved payment flow with better context
- Added RoleRaise branding to PayPal checkout

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Clear error messaging
- Automatic redirect to booking if PayPal fails
- 2-second delay before opening Calendly

## Testing PayPal Credit Card

### Test Credit Card Numbers (Sandbox Only):
```
Visa: 4111111111111111
Mastercard: 5555555555554444
American Express: 378282246310005
Expiry: Any future date
CVV: Any 3-digit number
```

### If Credit Card Still Fails:
1. Use PayPal account instead of credit card
2. System automatically opens Calendly for manual payment processing

3. PayPal production environment is more stable
4. Real credit card processing works better than sandbox

## Business Impact
