# Fix Vercel Deployment Issue

## Problem
You're seeing raw server code instead of your website because Vercel is not properly configured for a fullstack app.

## Solution: Redeploy with Correct Settings

### Step 1: Update Your GitHub Repository

1. **Download the updated files** from this Replit
2. **Replace the `vercel.json` file** in your GitHub repository with the new one I created
3. **Push the changes** to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Redeploy on Vercel

1. **Go to your Vercel dashboard**
2. **Find your project** (`roleraise-platform`)
3. **Click "Redeploy"** or trigger a new deployment

### Step 3: Configure Build Settings in Vercel

In your Vercel project settings:
- **Framework Preset**: `Other`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

### Step 4: Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Vercel:
```
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=[Your PayPal Client ID]
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=[Your PayPal Client Secret]
GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL=[Your Google Apps Script URL]
VITE_CALENDLY_URL=https://calendly.com/kohlisahil151991
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Alternative: Deploy to Netlify Instead

If Vercel continues to have issues, Netlify is another excellent option:

1. **Go to https://netlify.com**
2. **Connect your GitHub repository**
3. **Configure build settings**:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
4. **Add environment variables**
5. **Deploy**

## What Should Happen

After fixing the configuration, your site should show:
- Your professional RoleRaise landing page
- Working PayPal payment buttons
- Calendly booking integration
- Career assessment form
- All the features you built

## Expected URLs

- **Vercel URL**: `roleraise-platform-xyz.vercel.app`
- **Custom domain**: `roleraise.com` (after DNS setup)

The raw server code issue will be resolved with the proper Vercel configuration.
